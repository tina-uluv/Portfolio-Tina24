    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>Some interests and hobbies that I have include: Public speaking, learning science, track & feild and hiking and other interpersonal skills. 
        I througly enjoy public speaking due to the concept of expressing yourself through your words and influencing others in a significant way. 
        In my opinion, all great leaders are amazing communicators. In addition, science has always intruiged me and it's one of those subjects and concepts
        that you can never identify as "all-knowing". I enjoy hiking and track since kinesthetic activites excite me as well. </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
        <p> As typical as this may sound, I love food. I see myself travelling to many places in the world and trying various foods.
          I've always been a fan of exploring different parts of the world and learning along the way. 
             I'm attracted to hot/warm weather, hence why I plan to live in a warm climate in the future. 
             My favourite colour is lavender purple ( not forever though, it changes once every 2 months). 
             I enjoy studying health sciences/medical sciences 
            I'm an extrovert and an introvert, my family would descirbe me as an introvert but my friends say likewise. 
            Lastly, my favourite animal is a lion. </p>
